# Hi there 👋

With a background in medicine, I’m fascinated by complex systems — whether it’s the human body or a codebase.  
I still geek out over anatomy, but now I’m channeling that same curiosity into software testing and automation.  
Curiosity drives me, whether I’m debugging, baking, or studying Spanish.
